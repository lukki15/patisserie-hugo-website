In principle, you have the rights to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, revocation and objection. If you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or that your data protection rights have been violated in any other way, you can complain to the supervisory authority. In Austria, this is the data protection authority.

The EU Commission offers the possibility of online dispute resolution on a platform operated by it (so-called "ODR platform").
